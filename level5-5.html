        There are <strong>so many roots</strong> to the tree of anger   
        <br>that sometimes the <strong>branches shatter</strong>   
        <br>before they bear.

        <br><br>Sitting in Nedicks
        <br>the women rally before they march   
        <br>discussing the problematic girls   
        <br>they hire to make them free.
        <br>An almost white counterman passes   
        <br>a waiting brother to serve them first   
        <br>and the ladies <strong>neither notice nor reject</strong>   
        <br>the slighter pleasures of their slavery.
        <br>But I who am bound by my mirror   
        <br>as well as my bed
        <br>see causes in colour
        <br>as well as sex

        <br><br>and sit here wondering   
        <br><em>which me will survive</em>   
        <br>all these <strong>liberations.</strong>
