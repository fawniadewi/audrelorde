            <h1><li>Who Said It Was Simple<br>by Audre Lorde</li></h1>
            <h2><br><li>There are so many roots to the tree of anger   
                <br>that sometimes the branches shatter   
                <br>before they bear.</li></h2>
            <h3><li>Sitting in Nedicks
                <br>the women rally before they march   
                <br>discussing the problematic girls   
                <br>they hire to make them free.</li></h3>
            <h4><li>An almost white counterman passes   
                <br>a waiting brother to serve them first   
                <br>and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
                <br>the slighter pleasures of their slavery.</li></h4>
            <h5><li>But I who am bound by my mirror   
                <br>as well as my bed
                <br>see causes in colour
                <br>as well as sex
            </h5>
            <h6>and sit here wondering   
                <br>which me will survive   
                <br>all these liberations.</li></h6>
