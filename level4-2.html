        <p class="verse1">There are <strong>so many roots</strong> to the tree of anger   
            <br>that sometimes the branches shatter   
            <br>before they bear.
            <br><br>Sitting in Nedicks
            <br>the women rally before they march   
            <br>discussing the problematic girls   
            <br>they hire to make them free.
            <br>An almost white counterman passes   
            <br>a waiting brother to serve them first   
            <br>and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
            <br>the slighter pleasures of their slavery.
            <br>But I who am bound by my mirror   
            <br>as well as my bed
            <br>see causes in colour
            <br>as well as sex
    
            <br><br>and sit here wondering   
            <br><em>which me will survive</em>   
            <br>all these liberations.
