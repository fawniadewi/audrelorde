            <div class="poem">There are so many roots to the tree of anger   
                <br>that sometimes the branches shatter   
                <br>before they bear.
                
            <p><br><br>Sitting in Nedicks
                <br>the women rally before they march   
                <br>discussing the problematic girls   
                <br>they hire to make them free.
                <br>An almost white counterman passes   
                <br>a waiting brother to serve them first   
                <br>and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
                <br>the slighter pleasures of their slavery.   
                <br>But I who am bound by my mirror   
                <br>as well as my bed
                <br>see causes in colour
                <br>as well as sex
            </p>
                
            <p><br><br>and sit here wondering   
                <br>which me will survive   
                <br>all these liberations.
