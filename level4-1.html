        <p>THERE ARE SO MANY</p>
        <p class="kedua">ROOTS TO THE TREE</p>
        <p class="ketiga">OF ANGER</p>
        <p class="keempat">that sometimes the branches shatter<br>before they bear.</p>
        <p class="S">Sitting in Nedicks</p>
        <p class="symbol">!</p>
        <p class="kelima">the women rally before they march   
            <br>discussing the problematic girls   
            <br>they hire to make them free.</p>
        <p class="symbol1">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
        <p class="keenam">An almost white counterman passes   
            <br>a waiting brother to serve them first   
            <br>and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
            <br>the slighter pleasures of their slavery.</p>
        <p class="ketujuh">But I who am bound by my mirror   
            <br>as well as my bed
            <br>see causes in colour
            <br>as well as sex
        </p>
        <p class="kedelapan">and sit here wondering</p>
        <p class="kesembilan">
            which me will survive   
            <br>all these liberations.
